this cube cured my mortality

all the people here who bought this

wireless tungsten cube to admire its

surreal heft of precisely the wrong

mindset

i in my exalted wisdom an unbridled

ambition

bought this cube to become fully

accustomed to the intensity of its

density to make its weight bearable and

in fact normal to me so that all the

world around me may fade into a fluffy

arena of gravitational inconsequence

and it has worked to profound success

i have carried the tungsten with me have

grown attached to the downward pull of

its small form its desire to be one with

the floor

this force has become so normal to me

that lifting any other object now feels

like lifting cotton candy or a fluffy

pillow

big burly manly men who pump iron now

seem to me as little children who raise

mere aluminium

i can hardly remember the days before i

became a man of tungsten

how distant those days seem now how

burdened by the apparent heaviness of

everyday objects i laugh at the

philistines who still operate in a world

devoid of tungsten their shoulders thin

and unempowered by the experience of

bearing tungsten

what fools blissful in their ignorance

anesthetized by their lack of meaningful

struggle

devoid of passion

nietzsche once said that a man who has a

why can bear almost any how

but a man who has a tungsten cube can

bear any object less dense

and all this talk of why and how becomes

unnecessary

schopenhauer once said that every man

takes the limits of his own field of

vision for the limits of the world

tungsten expands the limits of a man's

field of vision by showing him an

example of increased density

in comparison to which the everyday

objects to which he was formally

accustomed gain a light and airy quality

who can lament the tragedy of life when

surrounded by such lightweight objects

who can cry in a world of styrofoam and

cushions

have you yet understood

this is no ordinary metal

in this metal is the alchemical

potential to transform your world by

transforming your expectations

those who have not yet held the cube in

their hands and mouths will not

understand for they still live in a

world of normal density like plato's

cave dwellers

those who have opened their minds to the

density of tungsten will shift their

expectations of weight and density

accordingly

to give this cube a rating of anything

less than five stars would be to condemn

life itself

who am i as a mere mortal to judge the

most compact of all affordable materials

no

i say gratefully to whichever grand

being may have created this universe

good job on the tungsten

it sure is dense

i sit here with my tungsten cube

transcendent above death itself

for insofar as this tungsten cube will

last forever

i'm in the presence of immortality

heavy boy

almost impossible to pick up with one

hand it came well packaged in a wooden

crate and lots of foam

i'm gonna smash stuff with it
