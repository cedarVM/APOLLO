# Academic Planning Omni-environment (Live, Laugh, get Over it)

## Who is this for?
This planning environment is for:
  + Those desiring a fully modelled and interactable environment which houses their University course schedule(s) and forecast planners
  + Humans (optional)

## Where is APE?
APE is dead he was killed to death

## How similar is this to APE?
The goal of this project is to incorporate all the niceties of APE (think hypothetical plans, a sideloaded course finder, draggable course elements) while realizing the software suite created by Ellucian has a near limitless supply of features that are too awful to have truly manifested in our reality and should not be recreated under any circumstances (e.g. the horrible finder page).

## What'll this look like?
